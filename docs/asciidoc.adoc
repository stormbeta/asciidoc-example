= AsciiDoc Overview

AsciiDoc is an advanced alternative to markdown

== Setup

=== Ruby-based

****

* Better compatibility with third-party extensions
** and wrappers like `asciidoctor-confluence`

Cons::
* Ruby environments require more setup
* Lack of easy live-reloading for local editing
****

[source,ruby]
----
include::Gemfile[]
----

=== Node.js based

****
Pros::
* Easier to bootstrap
* Much easier to do live-reloads locally

Cons::
* npm ecosystem is fragile
* not compatible out-of-the-box with non-js extensions
** https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js/issues/84[workarounds may exist however]
